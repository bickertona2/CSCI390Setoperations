SET OPERATIONS ASSIGNMENT

Admittedly I don't really have much to go off of here, as when I tried to test this on hopper it gave me the error that nodejs was not installed, so I was unable to test this code before I needed to turn it in, as such it is likely inoperable, but we can remedy that later. I am not super familiar with set operations as I am currently in discreet mathematics so hopefully the logic there works even if the code doesn't. All of the code here is mine and hand typed, though I did use google to find out certian operations and websites to better familiarize myself with things like string split and array operations.

EDIT: it worked im just stupid we have overcome

HOW TO USE

type "node SetOperations.js [OPTION]"

options:

-h, --help

-u, --union [SET1] [SET2]

-i, --intersection [SET1] [SET2]

-d, -- difference [SET1] [SET2]
